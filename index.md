  <h2>Welcome to the CT Competence Center Freiburg</h2>
</div>



<div style="text-align: justify;">
Computed tomography is a key technology for the non-destructive analysis and characterization of materials, biological tissues, and technical components. The CT Competence Center Freiburg provides scientists and industry partners with a central platform to leverage the diverse capabilities of CT technology for research and development.
<br>
The center integrates preclinical, clinical, and materials science CT systems, enabling a wide range of applications. While preclinical CT systems are primarily used in biomedical research and preclinical imaging, clinical CT scanners are available for medical and translational studies. Additionally, the center includes high-resolution CT systems specifically optimized for materials science and engineering applications.
<br>
A unique feature of materials science CT analyses is the ability to simulate mechanical stress scenarios in situ. By combining CT scans with integrated test stands, materials and components can be examined under realistic tensile and compressive loads. This method allows for a detailed real-time analysis of deformation and damage mechanisms, contributing to the development of innovative materials and structures.
<br>
The CT Competence Center Freiburg thus provides a unique infrastructure for interdisciplinary research and application-oriented development. Whether for medical imaging, materials testing, or industrial quality assurance â€“ the available CT technologies offer a broad range of possibilities for analyzing and visualizing complex structures.
<br>
We invite scientists, companies, and project partners to take advantage of the diverse opportunities at the CT Competence Center Freiburg and to collaborate in developing new insights and applications.

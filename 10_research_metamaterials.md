# Programming strain rate sensitivity into metamaterials

This research explores the feasibility of programming time-dependent damping behaviour into metamaterials, an attribute typically considered as an inherent material property. To date, the design of mechanical metamaterials has been focused almost exclusively on time-independent or quasi-static properties. Designing time-dependent mechanical properties is still a relatively unexplored field. However, it is precisely here, where a considerable need for advanced materials, e.g., for crash and impact protection, can be fulfilled. Instead of relying on the intrinsic time-dependence of a given material, one would like to prescribe it in the design phase, along with its shape and other quasi-static properties. To address the gap, we propose a friction-based unit cell mechanism (see Fig. 1) that results in strain rate sensitive behaviour, independent of the base material’s property. Friction is a time-dependent phenomena and we rely on friction to obtain strain rate sensitivity. The magnitude of the friction force is controlled by the geometry of the curved beams. Parametric optimization of the unit cell geometry, combined with the surface morphology of the sliding interfaces, is key to exploiting friction properties and achieving programmable strain rate sensitivity.

The designed mechanism adds significant strain rate sensitivity in comparison to the inherent base material (titanium alloy) property* |

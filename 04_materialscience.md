# CT for Materials Science

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) is a powerful tool for non-destructive 3D imaging and analysis of materials at a microscopic scale. It provides high-resolution insights into a material’s internal structure, porosity, cracks, and density variations. This technology is widely used in materials research, engineering, and quality control to study metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. With sub-micron resolution, micro-CT enables precise visualization of defects and structural integrity without damaging the sample. Advanced scanning and reconstruction techniques allow in situ testing under different conditions, making micro-CT an essential tool for developing and optimizing new materials in various industries.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
 <br>
  The EasyTom 150/160 CT system from RX Solutions is a versatile X-ray and computed tomography system. With a flexible combination of high-performance X-ray tubes (150 micro or 160 kV nano), it delivers high image quality with resolutions down to below one micrometer. Key features of the system include a choice of detectors—either a flat panel with a 124 µm pixel pitch or a CCD with up to a 9 µm pixel pitch—precise mechanical sample positioning, automated scanning processes, and a variety of measurement protocols, including laminography. It is suitable for analyzing a wide range of materials and components, from small electronic parts and additively manufactured materials to larger industrial components. In-situ tensile and compression tests can be conducted using a Deben CT5000 load cell, enabling mechanical testing within the system. Samples with diameters and heights of approximately 5–20 mm can be subjected to loads of up to 5 kN.
